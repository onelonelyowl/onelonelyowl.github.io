        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>I'm Tom. Well more specifically, I'm a recent university graduate with an interest in data science and software development.
            In my free time I like gaming 🎮, playing my guitar 🎸, listening to music 🎼 and running 🏃‍♂️ (currently training for a half marathon). 
            When I have free time on the weekends I also like to volunteer at a local food distribution charity. I used to enjoy mountain biking and hiking a lot
            but since I moved to London I haven't had many opportunities to do either of these things, sadly.
