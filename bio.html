        <h1>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>I'm <b>Tom</b>. Well more specifically, I'm a recent university graduate with an interest in data science and software development.
            In my free time I enjoy:</p>
        <ul>
              <li>🎮 gaming 🎮</li>
              <li>🎸 playing my guitar 🎸</li>
              <li>🎼 listening to music 🎼</li>
              <li>🏃‍♂️ running 🏃‍♂️ (currently training for a half marathon)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When I have free time on the weekends I also volunteer at a local food distribution charity. I also enjoy mountain biking and hiking a lot
            but since moving to London I haven't had many chances to do so.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy watching basketball and football and engaging in statistical analysis of players and teams within these sports. My university dissertation
            was about using different types of basketball statistics to predict the outcome of future games.</p>
